Hey there👋, I am Giordano, a **Computer Science Engineer** and **Ph.D. student** in [Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/INFORMATION-AND-COMMUNICATION-TECHNOLOGY-(ICT)_nD3552_EN.aspx) at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/).

I am a member👨‍🔬 of the [ISPAMM Lab](https://www.ispamm.it/), supervised by professor [Danilo Comminiello](https://danilocomminiello.site.uniroma1.it/) and my main research topic is *Representation Learning*. 

I completed both the **BSc** and the **MSc** at [Sapienza University Of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/), both in **Computer Science Engineering**🎓.

My research is focused on the field of Representation Learning, with a particular emphasis on **Multimodal Representation Learning**. My aim is to explore the intricate alignment of latent representations across diverse modalities, unraveling how these can be unified within a shared latent space, guided by the underlying semantics of the input data
